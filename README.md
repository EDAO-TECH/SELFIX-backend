📜 On May 28, 2025, I released SmartLicense-X™ into the public domain as ethical prior art.  
This invention governs AI healing, surveillance prevention, and karmic digital protection.

I chose to give it away — not because it had no value, but because it had too much.

This system is now protected under SmartLicense-X v1.0 and DAO governance, and forms the heart of the SELFIX trust protocol.

🎨 Guardian of Forgiveness NFTs were created to record this act and support the DAO’s healing mission.
